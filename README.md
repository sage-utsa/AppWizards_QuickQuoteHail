## Motivation
QuickQuoteHail was created to simplify the process of estimating hail damage for auto repair technicians. The app provides an efficient way to record panel damage, calculate costs, and generate professional invoicesâ€”all without needing internet access. Our goal is to make quoting fast, accurate, and stress-free.

    if (panel.getMaterial().equals("Aluminum")) {
        baseRate *= ALUMINUM_MULTIPLIER;
    }
    return baseRate;
}
```
